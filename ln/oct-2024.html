       <h2>Hi, Exun Alum!</h2>
       <p>
        The previous newsletter drew a very encouraging response, and the community has grown to 188 people as of writing this! Here's some highlights from previous month, and updates on upcoming events.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Upcoming</h3>
      
      <h4>Delhi Mixer</h4>
      <img src="https://images.lumacdn.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,dpr=2,background=white,quality=75,width=400,height=400/event-covers/is/182b53f0-14d5-46d3-9dae-e9f7d1e4f749" width=300 style="display:block; margin: auto;" />
      <p>
        We've finalised the location for the event: the <strong>India International Centre</strong>. You can sign up on
        <a href="https://lu.ma/0fbx1suw" target="_blank"
          >the event page</a
        >. It's a small venue so we have very few slots left - if you're planning to attend, make sure you send in the registration fees to confirm your place at the event.<br/>To those of you who can make it to the Delhi mixer, we're looking
        forward to meeting you! 
      </p>

      <h3>Highlights</h3> 
      
      <h4>Events</h4>
      There were multiple alumni meet-ups across cities last month, so we started a list to keep track of them: <a href="https://www.exunalumni.com/events" target="_blank">https://www.exunalumni.com/events</a>

      </figure>
      
      <h4>Job Posts</h4>
      A few members posted jobs that they – or people they know - are hiring for, so we decided to get – you guessed it – a list going to track those: <a href="https://exunalumni.com/hiring" target="_blank">https://exunalumni.com/hiring</a>
      
      <h4>Community</h4>
      The community saw a lot of new members joining; with multiple memories, old pictures and anecdotes being exchanged on the group.
      If you haven't joined yet, here's the link to the WhatsApp community: <a href="https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ffeaz5O7UqUEBXixTWs8C8" target="_blank">https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ffeaz5O7UqUEBXixTWs8C8</a>

         We're still working on getting more legal formalities out of the way so that we can take the fundraising process – which so many of you wanted to be a part of – forward. That'll help us move the needle on the actual mission, but incremental progress, I guess. More updates on this hopefully in the coming months.

          PS: An active discussion happened around Exun Alumni merch in the group, and we're soliciting opinions/demand: Would you be interested in Exun Alumni branded merchandise? Something from <a href="https://merchery.co/" target="_blank">https://merchery.co/</a> perhaps? (I'm looking at the Patagonia sweaters 👀) Write back with suggestions of items if you are indeed interested, and we might take this up!
