      <h2>Hi, Exun Alum!</h2>
      <p>
        Here's updates from an eventful October filled with community gatherings
        and celebrations 😄
      </p>

      <h3>Upcoming</h3>

      <h4>December Delhi meetup</h4>
      <p>
        We're planning an informal gathering in Delhi on the last weekend of the
        year (December 28-29). This will be a casual meet-up for alumni who are
        in town for the holidays. Details will be shared in the WhatsApp group -
        if you're interested in joining and missed voting in the poll on
        WhatsApp, please let us know so we can plan accordingly!
      </p>

        The Delhi Mixer at the India International Centre was special! Alumni
        from various batches came together for an evening of nostalgia,
        networking, and great conversations. There was representation across
        batches (I met some people after 10+ years), and the event had a small
        quiz, some lunch and a keynote by

            >Urgently need TypeScript devs for my workplace. Company is based in
            Australia with worldwide clients. Pay is per hour - experienced devs
            can start at 25 USD or AUD equivalent, less for junior devs (to be
            discussed with management). Good work-life balance with minimal
            meetings (daily standup and biweekly reviews). Flexible timezone
            arrangements available. You'll work under me as the tech lead.
            Interview process: 30min technical interview + 30min management
            interview. Projects involve full-stack TypeScript work with AWS
            infrastructure (CDK/CloudFormation experience is a plus). Longer job
            description coming soon. Contact: vidur.butalia@lewinnovation.com or
