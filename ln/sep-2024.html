      <h2>Hi, Exun alum!</h2>

      <p>
        It's been an exciting two months since we sent out the
        <a href="https://exunalumni.com/letter" target="_blank">first letter</a

          PS: How good is
          <a href="https://blackforestlabs.ai/" target="_blank">Flux</a>, the

          for the mixer in one prompt, it cost $0.025 (in free credits) and I
          think it looks pretty darn neat. <br /><br />
          As always, feel free to reply to this email with any suggestions or
          ideas.
