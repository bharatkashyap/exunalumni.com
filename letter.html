      <h2>Hi, Exun alum!</h2>

      <p>
        If you're reading this, you are someone whose life in school was, in
        some way, touched by Exun. For a group of us, the impact Exun had on our
        lives in school was so profound that even now, years later, each of us
        feels – individually – very strongly about expanding that community and
        its transformative power beyond the boundaries of the school.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <h3>TL;DR Goals:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Funding:</strong> Establish an alumni organisation to
            support and sustain Exun beyond school
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Events:</strong> Organise events to connect Exun alumni and
            current members, fostering a strong network
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Support:</strong> Provide wisdom, advice, and resources from
            Exun alumni to current students and recent graduates
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        Bharat (Exun 2015) and Karmanya (Exun 2015) were put in touch with
        Gursartaj (Exun 2007) and Ankit (Exun 2000) by Mukesh Sir around the
        idea of forming an alumni organisation to help Exun persist and prosper
        even outside of school. A few Zoom meetings in, we had gone from barely
        knowing each other to collaborating over a plan to build an Exun Alumni
        Network. This letter is part of that plan - to reach out to people we
        feel will be early believers in the idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        To me, the synergy that developed in only a couple video calls among the
        four of us symbolises what the potential really is: Exun (and Mukesh
        Sir's office) was a place in school for talented, precocious,
        like-minded young kids to find each other.
      </p>

      <h3>The Plan for Now:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We establish a trust/society/non-profit company (Exun Alumni Network)
        </li>
        <li>
          We build online communities on multiple social media targeting diverse
          age groups
        </li>
        <li>
          We have a volunteer-run website with links to social media and some
          descriptive content
        </li>
        <li>
          We have online sessions with alumni from diverse backgrounds through
          the year
        </li>
        <li>
          We hire a few employees as part of the Alumni Network to run our
          social media communities
        </li>
        <li>We conduct one offline event a year at DPS RK Puram's campus</li>
        <li>
          As a stretch goal, we run offline spaces across cities for members
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Get Involved!</h3>
